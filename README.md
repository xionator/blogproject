1. Introduction
   1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the software requirements for a blog website using a microservice architecture with Spring Boot, Kafka, and Docker.

1. Scope

This SRS covers the development of a blog website that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The system will be built using a microservice architecture, leveraging Spring Boot for the backend services, Kafka for inter-service communication, and Docker for containerization and deployment.

1. System Overview
   1. Microservices

The system will be composed of the following microservices:

1. User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
1. Blog Post Service: Manages blog post creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
1. Comment Service: Manages comments on blog posts.

2\.2 Technology Stack

- Backend: Spring Boot
- Containerization & Deployment: Docker

3\. Functional Requirements

3\.1 Blog Post Service

1. Create Post: Authenticated users can create a new blog post.
1. Read Post: Users can view blog posts.
1. Update Post: Authenticated users can edit their blog posts.
1. Delete Post: Authenticated users can delete their blog posts.

3\.2 Comment Service

1. Add Comment: Authenticated users can add comments to a blog post.
1. Delete Comment: Authenticated users can delete their comments.

4\. Non-Functional Requirements

4\.1 Performance

The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and requests.

4\.2 Security

User data should be securely stored and transmitted. Passwords should be hashed and all data exchanges should be over HTTPS.

4\.3 Scalability

The system should be easily scalable, which is facilitated by the use of microservices and Docker.
